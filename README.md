The Word Guessing Game

The Word Guessing Game is based on the concept of Hangman or Wheel of Fortune, where players have to guess letters of a word. In this implementation, 
the binary search algorithm is utilized to optimize the guessing process.
I have created a list called "word_list" that contains several fruit names. The player will have 5 incorrect guess attempts.

In the game, the player is presented with a partially hidden word, represented by underscores, and they need to guess the letters one by one. 
If a guessed letter is correct, it is revealed in the corresponding positions of the word.
However, if the guessed letter is incorrect, the player's incorrect guess count increases.
The game continues until the player correctly guesses the word or runs out of guess attempts.
With the help of the binary search algorithm, the program efficiently searches for the guessed letters within the selected word.
A simple interface was created using tkinter.

Have fun playing The Word Guessing Game and test your fruit word knowledge!
